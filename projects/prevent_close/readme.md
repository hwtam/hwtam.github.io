# Prevent browser tab close

# [https://hwtam.github.io/projects/prevent_close/main.html](https://hwtam.github.io/projects/prevent_close/main.html)

The idea of this webpage is from [https://maki-chan.de/preventclose.htm](https://maki-chan.de/preventclose.htm). Please support the author through the link if you want.

This webpage is just a redesign.

### Things I changed:

- dark theme
- add a hint to inform the user whether the script is currently enabled or disabled
- add a refresh button to disable the script

## What is it?

It can stop the browser from closing if you accidentally close it.
